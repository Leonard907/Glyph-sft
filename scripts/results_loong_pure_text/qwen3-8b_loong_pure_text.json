Question you need to answer: What is the name of the company with a Basic Earnings Per Share of $(0.001)?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial statements, the company with a Basic Earnings Per Share of $(0.001) is **Beam Global**.\n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1.  Looking at the \"Beam Global\" financial statements, specifically the \"Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024, we can find the line item \"Basic and diluted net loss per share\".\n2.  The table clearly lists \"Basic and diluted net loss per share\" as \"$ (0.21)\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n3.  The question asks for a Basic Earnings Per Share of $(0.001). While the exact figure $(0.001) doesn't appear verbatim in the provided text for Beam Global, the closest match is the $(0.21) figure. However, the question might be referencing a different format or rounding.\n4.  Checking the other companies:\n    *   **Corner Growth Acquisition Corp.**: Their \"Basic and diluted net loss per share\" is listed as \"$ (0.001)\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n    *   **BioLargo, Inc.**: Their \"Basic (loss) income per share attributable to common shareholders\" is listed as \"$ (0.00)\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n    *   **Biostax Corp.**: Their \"Basic EPS\" is listed as \"$ (0.00)\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n5.  Only **Corner Growth Acquisition Corp.** has a Basic EPS explicitly listed as $(0.001).\n\nTherefore, the company with a Basic Earnings Per Share of $(0.001) is **Corner Growth Acquisition Corp.**\n\n(Note: The question mentions \"Basic Earnings Per Share,\" which typically implies a positive value, but the financial statements show a loss, hence a negative value. The value $(0.001) matches Corner Growth Acquisition Corp.'s reported figure.)"

    "answer": "Based on the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period\" figures extracted from the provided financial statements, the companies are categorized as follows:\n\n**High Cash (over 10,000,000)**:\n* **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $2,823,000 (Note: This appears to be a typo or misalignment in the provided text; the figure is inconsistent with the context of the company's size and the other figures. However, strictly following the text, it falls under \"low cash\".)\n* **American Shared Hospital Services**: $13,042,000\n* **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**: $18,544,000\n* **ClearOne, Inc.**: $18,544,000\n\n**Medium Cash (over 1,000,000 and below 10,000,000)**:\n* **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $2,823,000 (Note: Again, this figure seems inconsistent with the context, but based on the text, it fits this category.)\n* **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust**: $17,281,000 (Note: This figure exceeds 10,000,000, so it belongs in the \"High Cash\" category.)\n\n**Low Cash (above 0 and below 1,000,000)**:\n* **Broad Street Realty, Inc.**: $13,042,000 (Note: This figure exceeds 1,000,000, so it belongs in the \"Medium Cash\" category.)\n\n**No Cash (0 and below)**:\n* **None of the companies listed have cash balances of 0 or below.**\n\n---\n\n**Correction Note:** There appears to be a discrepancy in the provided text for GSE Systems, Inc.'s cash balance. The text states \"$2,823,000\", which is below 1,000,000, placing it in the \"Low Cash\" category. However, the text also mentions \"$2,823,000\" as the cash balance for the company in the \"High Cash\" category. This inconsistency suggests a potential error in the provided data. Based on the explicit instruction to categorize based on the text, GSE Systems, Inc. would fall under \"Low Cash\".\n\nTherefore, the corrected categorization is:\n\n**High Cash (over 10,000,000)**:\n* **American Shared Hospital Services**: $13,042,000\n* **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**: $18,544,000\n* **ClearOne, Inc.**: $18,544,000\n\n**Medium Cash (over 1,000,000 and below 10,000,000)**:\n* **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust**: $17,281,000\n\n**Low Cash (above 0 and below 1,000,000)**:\n* **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $2,823,000\n\n**No Cash (0 and below)**:\n* **None**\n\n---"

    "answer": "Based on the provided financial statements, here is the categorization of the companies by 'Total Liabilities':\n\n**High Liabilities (over $1,000,000,000)**:\n*   **GSE Systems, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $16,751,000 (Note: This appears to be a typo in the provided text; the total assets are $20,587,000, and total liabilities are $16,751,000, which is less than $1 billion. However, the context suggests this is a mistake, as the company is a small-cap company. Let's classify it correctly based on the actual figures provided in the text, which show total liabilities of $16,751,000, placing it in the Low Liabilities category. The figure of $16,751,000 is likely meant to be $1,675,100, which would fall into the Medium Liabilities category. But strictly following the text, it falls into Low Liabilities. We'll list it under Low Liabilities as per the text.)*\n*   **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**: Total Liabilities = $23,739,000 (Note: This is less than $1 billion, so it falls into the Low Liabilities category. The text says \"Total liabilities... $23,739,000\", which is less than $100 million? Wait, let's check again. The text says \"Total liabilities... $23,739,000\". This is less than $100 million? No, $23,739,000 is $23.7 million, which is less than $100 million. So it falls into the Low Liabilities category.)*\n*   **ClearOne, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $19,867,000 (Note: This is less than $100 million, so it falls into the Low Liabilities category. The text says \"Total liabilities... $19,867,000\", which is less than $100 million.)*\n*   **Broad Street Realty, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $234,272,000 (Note: This is less than $1 billion, so it falls into the Low Liabilities category. The text says \"Total liabilities... $234,272,000\", which is less than $100 million? No, $234,272,000 is $234.272 million, which is less than $1 billion, but more than $100 million. So it falls into the Medium Liabilities category.)*\n*   **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust**: Total Liabilities = $1,000,000 (Note: This is less than $100 million, so it falls into the Low Liabilities category. The text says \"Expense reserve... $1,000,000\", which is less than $100 million.)*\n\nWait, let's re-examine the figures:\n\n*   **GSE Systems, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $16,751,000 (Text says \"$16,751,000\")\n*   **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**: Total Liabilities = $23,739,000 (Text says \"$23,739,000\")\n*   **ClearOne, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $19,867,000 (Text says \"$19,867,000\")\n*   **Broad Street Realty, Inc.**: Total Liabilities = $234,272,000 (Text says \"$234,272,000\")\n*   **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust**: Total Liabilities = $1,000,000 (Text says \"Expense reserve... $1,000,000\")\n\nNow, let's categorize them correctly:\n\n*   **High Liabilities (over $1,000,000,000)**: None of the companies listed have total liabilities exceeding $1 billion.\n*   **Medium Liabilities (over $100,000,000 and below $1,000,000,000)**: Only **Broad Street Realty, Inc.** fits this category with $234,272,000.\n*   **Low Liabilities (above $0 and below $100,000,000)**: **GSE Systems, Inc.**, **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**, **ClearOne, Inc.**, and **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust** fit this category.\n*   **Negligible Liabilities ($0 and below)**: None of the companies listed have total liabilities of $0 or below.\n\nTherefore, the correct categorization is:\n\n**High Liabilities (over $1,000,000,000)**: []\n**Medium Liabilities (over $100,000,000 and below $1,000,000,000)**: [Broad Street Realty, Inc.]\n**Low Liabilities (above $0 and below $100,000,000)**: [GSE Systems, Inc., 1st Franklin Financial Corporation, ClearOne, Inc., Cross Timbers Royalty Trust]\n**Negligible Liabilities ($0 and below)**: []"

However, the text also states that Coyni, Inc.'s EPS for the three months ended March 31, 2024 was $(0.00), which is technically zero, not negative. But since the instruction asks for negative EPS, and $(0.00) is not negative, it doesn't fit the negative EPS category. So, Coyni, Inc. should be placed in the Low EPS category.\n\nTherefore, the corrected categorization is:\n\n**High EPS (over $1.00)**:\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\n**Medium EPS (over $0.00 and below $1.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\n**Low EPS (above $(1.00) and below $0.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\n**Negative EPS ($(1.00) and below)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\nWait, this is inconsistent. Let's re-read the instructions.\n\nThe instruction says: \"Place companies into the same collection for the same category and into different collections for different categories.\"\n\nSo, let's list them correctly based on the EPS values provided in the financial statements.\n\n**High EPS (over $1.00)**:\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $0.44\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $0.48\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $0.10\n\n**Medium EPS (over $0.00 and below $1.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\n**Low EPS (above $(1.00) and below $0.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\n**Negative EPS ($(1.00) and below)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\nActually, the EPS for Coyni, Inc. is $(0.00) for the three months ended March 31, 2024, which is not negative. So, it should not be in the Negative EPS category.\n\nLet's go back to the text.\n\nThe text says for Coyni, Inc.: \"Net loss per share – basic and diluted... $ (0.00)\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024.\n\nAnd for the three months ended March 31, 2023: \"Net loss per share – basic and diluted... $ (0.01)\".\n\nSo, Coyni, Inc. has a negative EPS for 2023, but a zero EPS for 2024.\n\nGiven the instruction, we'll categorize based on the EPS value for the period in question (March 31, 2024).\n\nSo, for March 31, 2024:\n\n**High EPS (over $1.00)**:\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $0.44\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $0.48\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $0.10\n\n**Medium EPS (over $0.00 and below $1.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\n**Low EPS (above $(1.00) and below $0.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\n**Negative EPS ($(1.00) and below)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**: $(0.00)\n*   **CirTran Corporation**: $(0.01)\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**: $(0.01)\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: $(0.01)\n\nBut this is still inconsistent. Let's look at the exact wording.\n\nThe instruction says: \"negative EPS ($(1.00) and below)\". This implies EPS less than or equal to -$1.00.\n\nSince all the EPS values are either $0.00 or negative numbers greater than -$1.00, none of the companies have EPS less than or equal to -$1.00.\n\nTherefore, the \"Negative EPS\" category is empty.\n\nSo, the final categorization is:\n\n**High EPS (over $1.00)**:\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n\n**Medium EPS (over $0.00 and below $1.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\n**Low EPS (above $(1.00) and below $0.00)**:\n*   **Coyni, Inc.**\n*   **CirTran Corporation**\n*   **Dawson Geophysical Company**\n*   **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**\n\n**Negative EPS ($(1.00) and below)**:\n*(Empty)*\n\nThis is the most accurate categorization based on the provided data."

Instead, liabilities are broken down into specific categories such as \"Accounts Payable\", \"Accrued Compensation\", \"Accrued Interest\", \"Other Liabilities\", and \"Total Liabilities\".\n\nHowever, if we interpret the question as asking to categorize the companies based on their \"Total Liabilities\" (which is the sum of all liabilities), we can categorize the companies as follows:\n\n1. High Liabilities (over $10,000,000):\n   - None of the companies listed have total liabilities exceeding $10,000,000.\n\n2. Medium Liabilities (over $100,000,000 and below $10,000,000):\n   - None of the companies listed have total liabilities falling within this range.\n\n3. Low Liabilities (above $0 and below $100,000,000):\n   - All companies listed have total liabilities below $100,000,000.\n\n4. No Liabilities (0 and below):\n   - None of the companies listed have total liabilities of $0 or below.\n\nTherefore, all companies listed fall into the \"Low Liabilities\" category, as their total liabilities are all below $100,000,000.\n\nCollections:\n- Low Liabilities: Equus Total Return, Inc., Grant Park Futures Fund Limited Partnership, EQUUS ENERGY, LLC, Morgan E&P, LLC\n\nNote: The categorization is based on the assumption that \"Total Liabilities\" is meant to encompass all liabilities, as no company listed has liabilities exceeding $100,000,000. If \"Total Current Liabilities\" was intended to be used, the same categorization would apply, as none of the companies listed have current liabilities exceeding $100,000,000."

The \"Low Expenses\" category includes companies with operating expenses above $0 and below $100,000, which is why Equus Total Return, Inc. falls into this category despite having $4,172,000 in operating expenses. This seems to be an error in the categorization logic, as $4,172,000 clearly exceeds $100,000. Therefore, Equus Total Return, Inc. should be placed in the \"Medium Expenses\" category.\n\nCorrected categorization:\n- **High Expenses (over $1,000,000)**: AgEagle Aerial Systems Inc.\n- **Medium Expenses (over $100,000 and below $1,000,000)**: Dominari Holdings Inc., Equus Total Return, Inc.\n- **Low Expenses (above $0 and below $100,000)**: None\n- **No Expenses (0)**: None\n\nThis corrected categorization ensures that the companies are properly grouped according to the specified expense thresholds."

    "answer": "Based on the \"Cash and Cash Equivalents\" figures presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the quarter ended March 31, 2024, the companies can be categorized as follows:\n\n**High Balance (over $10,000,000)**:\n*   **Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc.**: $3,567,000 (Note: This appears to be a typo in the provided text; the figure should be $3,567,000, which is actually a low balance. However, according to the text, the company has $3.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, which places it in the High Balance category. Let's use the figure explicitly stated in the text: $3,900,000 is incorrect. The text says \"$3,900,000\", which is clearly less than $10,000,000.

The decrease is also confirmed by the \"Share Repurchase Program\" section in the 2024 Form 10-K, which details the repurchase of 143,108 shares in 2023, contributing to the overall decrease in shares outstanding from 2023 to 2024."

(AVNI):\n\n*   **2021:** The company had **34,148,518** shares issued and outstanding.\n*   **2022:** The company had **4,610,670** shares issued and outstanding.\n*   **2023:** The company had **107,845,554** shares issued and outstanding.\n*   **2024:** The company had **107,845,554** shares issued and outstanding.\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n\n1.  **2021 to 2022:** There was a significant *decrease* in the number of shares outstanding, dropping from 34.1 million to 4.6 million. This was largely due to the company's previous status as a \"shell\" company and the restructuring of its capital structure, including a reverse stock split.\n2.  **2022 to 2023:** There was a massive *increase* in the number of shares outstanding, jumping from 4.6 million to 107.8 million. This was primarily driven by the acquisition of Down2Fish Charters, LLC, which involved issuing a large number of new shares (4,800,000) and the issuance of shares to settle debt and for other purposes.\n3.  **2023 to 2024:** The number of shares outstanding remained *unchanged* at 107.8 million. This stability reflects the completion of the acquisition and the finalization of the capital structure, including the forward stock split that took effect in 2023.\n\nIn summary, the trend shows a dramatic reduction in share count in 2022, followed by a substantial increase in 2023, and stabilization at a much higher level in 2024. The company's share capital has grown significantly since 2022, reflecting its transition from a shell company to an operating business."

Question you need to answer: What significant change can be observed in the Share Capital of American Battery Materials, Inc. from the 2023 to the 2024 Annual Report?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided 10-K filings for **American Battery Materials, Inc.**, the significant change in Share Capital from the 2023 to the 2024 Annual Report is a **reverse stock split**.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **2023 Annual Report (Form 10-K)**:\n    *   The company's common stock was listed with a par value of $0.001.\n    *   The number of shares outstanding was **11,375,459**.\n    *   The company's common stock was trading under the ticker symbol \"BLTH\".\n\n2.  **2024 Annual Report (Form 10-K)**:\n    *   The company underwent a **reverse stock split**.\n    *   The reverse split was implemented on **December 8, 2023**.\n    *   The reverse split ratio was **1-for-300**.\n    *   This means that for every 300 shares held by a shareholder, they received 1 share after the split.\n    *   The number of shares outstanding decreased dramatically. The 2024 report lists **3,791,819** shares outstanding (calculated as 11,375,459 / 300).\n    *   The company's common stock is now trading under the ticker symbol \"BLTH\" (same as before the split, but the number of shares has changed).\n\nTherefore, the most significant change in Share Capital is the **1-for-300 reverse stock split** implemented in late 2023, which drastically reduced the number of shares outstanding while proportionally increasing the price per share. This is explicitly mentioned in the 2024 report under \"Item 1 - Business\" and \"Item 5 - Market for Registrant’s Common Equity,\" and the financial statements reflect this change retrospectively."

The percentage increase would be 0% if the 2024 value equals the 2020 value, which is not typically meaningful for measuring growth. The significant increase occurred from 2020 to 2021, followed by a decline in subsequent years."

Question you need to answer: What is the trend of American Battery Materials, Inc.'s Share Capital from 2020 to 2024?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial statements for American Battery Materials, Inc.

This indicates a significant increase in the company's share capital during this period, likely due to the issuance of new shares, potentially through equity financing or stock-based compensation.\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that the \"Share Capital\" figure typically refers to the total par value of the shares outstanding, not the number of shares. The par value per share is $0.001, so the total par value of the shares outstanding increased proportionally with the increase in the number of shares.\n\nTherefore, the primary trend observed is a substantial increase in the number of shares outstanding from 2020 to 2022, with no change in the number of shares reported in 2023."

(formerly BoxScore Brands, Inc.), the Total Current Liabilities decreased significantly from **2022 to 2023**.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n*   **December 31, 2022:** Total Current Liabilities = **$1,505,711**\n*   **December 31, 2023:** Total Current Liabilities = **$3,373,471**\n\nWait, let me recalculate the decrease correctly.\n\nActually, looking at the numbers again:\n\n*   **December 31, 2022:** Total Current Liabilities = **$1,505,711**\n*   **December 31, 2023:** Total Current Liabilities = **$3,373,471**\n\nThis indicates an **increase**, not a decrease, from 2022 to 2023.\n\nLet's examine the trend from 2020 to 2023:\n\n*   **December 31, 2020:** Total Current Liabilities = **$8,026,380**\n*   **December 31, 2021:** Total Current Liabilities = **$9,152,725**\n*   **December 31, 2022:** Total Current Liabilities = **$1,505,711**\n*   **December 31, 2023:** Total Current Liabilities = **$3,373,471**\n\nLooking at the sequence:\n\n*   **2020 to 2021**: Increased from $8,026,380 to $9,152,725 (+$1,126,345)\n*   **2021 to 2022**: Decreased from $9,152,725 to $1,505,711 (-$7,647,014)\n*   **2022 to 2023**: Increased from $1,505,711 to $3,373,471 (+$1,867,760)\n\nTherefore, the largest decrease in Total Current Liabilities occurred from **2021 to 2022**, decreasing by $7,647,014.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the year that saw the largest *decrease*.
