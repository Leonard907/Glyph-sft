The paper you need to analyze is: Patchscopes: A Unifying Framework for Inspecting Hidden Representations of Language Models",
    "answer": "{\n  \"Reference\": [],\n  \"Citation\": [\n    \"Understanding the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) has raised both interest and concern regarding their safety and trustworthiness. Despite numerous efforts to ensure they adhere to safety standards and produce harmless content, some successes have been achieved in bypassing these restrictions, known as jailbreak attacks against LLMs. Adversarial prompts (or say, adversarial examples) generated using gradient-based methods exhibit outstanding performance in performing jailbreak attacks automatically. Nevertheless, due to the discrete nature of texts, the input gradient of LLMs struggles to precisely reflect the magnitude of loss changes from token replacements in the prompt, leading to limited attack success rates against safety-aligned LLMs, even in the white-box setting. In this paper, we explore new perspectives on the problem, suggesting that it can be alleviated by leveraging innovations inspired by transfer-based attacks that were originally proposed for attacking black-box image classification models. For the first time, we appropriate the ideologies of effective methods among these transfer-based attacks, i.e., Skip Gradient Method [48] and Intermediate Level Attack [16], for improving the effectiveness of automatically generated adversarial examples against white-box LLMs. Meanwhile, by discussing mechanisms behind the gains, new empirical results are drawn, and proper combinations of these methods are also developed.\",\n    \"In this work, we propose a modular framework called Patchscopes (\\\\$\\\\mathcal{P}\\\\$) for decoding human-like text to \\\"translating\\\" the information in their representations for humans. We show that many existing methods, including those that rely on vocabulary projections and computation interventions, can be viewed as instances of Patchscopes. The rows highlighted in green show Patchscope configurations that overcome several limitations of prior methods through more expressive inspection than training-data free and is more robust across layers. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the benefits and opportunities introduced by Patchscopes, focusing on auto-regressive LLMs. First, we consider the problem of estimating the model's next-token prediction from its intermediate representations. Next, we evaluate how well Patchscopes can decode specific attributes from an LLM’s representations, such as fine-grained analysis of the input contextualization process and the extent to which a more expressive model can be used to inspect hidden representations of a smaller model, and works comparably well in all but one of the remaining six. Beyond output estimation and attribute decoding, Patchscopes can address questions that are hard to answer with existing methods. In \\\\$\\\\S\\\\ 4.3\\\\$, we apply Patchscopes to study how LLMs contextualize input entity names in early layers, where vocabulary projections mostly fail and other methods, at best, provide only a binary signal of whether the entity name has been resolved (Youssef et al., 2023; Tenney et al., 2019). With a new Patchscope, we are able to verbalize the gradual entity resolution process. For example, we show that, as the model processes the final token on a different prompt, it reflects different entities starting from \\\"Great Britain\\\", to \\\"The Great Depression\\\", to finally resolving \\\"Alexander the Great\\\". Then, in \\\\$\\\\S\\\\ 4.4\\\\$, we show how one can further improve Patchscope expressivity by using a stronger target model, e.g., Vicuna 13B instead of Vicuna 7B.\"\n  ]\n}"

    "answer": "Based on the financial statements for CLEARONE, INC., specifically the \"UNAUDITED CONDENSED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\" presented on page 5 (image 103), we can determine the cash flow from investing activities.\n\nThe statement shows:\n- **Cash flows from investing activities:**\n    - Purchase of property and equipment: $(69) \n    - Purchase of intangibles: $(36)\n    - Proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities: $2,325\n    - Purchases of marketable securities: $(1,947)\n\nSumming these items gives us the net cash used or provided by investing activities:\n\n$$(69) + (-36) + 2,325 + (-1,947) = 273$$\n\nTherefore, the cash flow from investing activities for CLEARONE, INC. was $273 thousand.\n\nNote: The document also includes a note on page 108 (image 108) that states \"Net cash provided by investing activities $273\", which confirms the calculation.\n\n**Answer:** The cash flow from investing activities of CLEARONE INC. is $273 thousand."

Question you need to answer: What is the cash flow from financing activities for 1st FRANKLIN FINANCIAL CORP?",
    "answer": "Based on the financial statements provided for 1st Franklin Financial Corporation, specifically the \"CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\" (page 40), we can determine the cash flow from financing activities.\n\nThe statement shows:\n- **Net decrease in senior demand notes**: $(5,647,937)\n- **Advances on credit line**: $44,415,120\n- **Payments on credit line**: $(56,715,120)\n- **Commercial paper issued**: $30,920,487\n- **Commercial paper redeemed**: $(18,922,918)\n- **Subordinated debt securities issued**: $2,545,529\n- **Subordinated debt securities redeemed**: $(1,310,062)\n- **Dividends / distributions**: $(1,319,065)\n\nSumming these items gives the net cash used or provided by financing activities:\n\n$ -5,647,937 + 44,415,120 - 56,715,120 + 30,920,487 - 18,922,918 + 2,545,529 - 1,310,062 - 1,319,065 = -4,723,904 $\n\nTherefore, the net cash used by financing activities was $4,723,904.\n\nHowever, looking at the table more carefully, it appears that the final line item is \"Net Cash (Used) / Provided\", which should be the total for financing activities. The table also includes a separate line for \"Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\". This suggests that the financing activities section might be presented differently.\n\nLooking again at page 40, under \"CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES\", the last line is \"Net Cash (Used) / Provided\" with a value of $(4,723,904). This indicates a net use of cash from financing activities.\n\nThus, the cash flow from financing activities for 1st Franklin Financial Corp was a net outflow of $4,723,904."

Question you need to answer: What is the Basic Earnings Per Share of CROSS TIMBERS ROYALTY TRUST?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, specifically the Form 10-Q for CROSS TIMBERS ROYALTY TRUST dated March 31, 2024 (pages 5-7), we can determine the Basic Earnings Per Share.\n\nThe \"Condensed Statements of Distributable Income\" table on page 6 shows:\n- For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the \"Distributable income per unit\" was $0.248869.\n- The number of units outstanding is stated as 6,000,000.\n\nHowever, the document does not explicitly state a figure for \"Basic Earnings Per Share\". It provides \"Distributable income per unit\", which is calculated by dividing total distributable income by the number of units.\n\nIn contrast, the \"Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\" on page 18 under \"Net Loss per Common Share\" states that the Company has two classes of common stock, Class A and Class B, and that net income per common stock is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. This implies that earnings per share would be calculated similarly for both classes.\n\nFurthermore, the \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" section on page 29 mentions that the Trust's distributable income per unit was $0.248869 for the quarter ended March 31, 2024. However, it does not provide a separate line item for \"Basic Earnings Per Share\".\n\nGiven that the document consistently refers to \"distributable income per unit\" rather than \"earnings per share,\" and since there is no explicit calculation or statement of basic earnings per share for either class of common stock, it is not possible to definitively state the Basic Earnings Per Share from the provided text.\n\nTherefore, the Basic Earnings Per Share cannot be determined from the given information."

    "answer": "Based on the financial statements provided for Blue Dolphin Energy Company, specifically the \"Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets\" (page 10), we can determine the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents.\n\nThe table presents data for March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023. The line item \"Cash and cash equivalents\" shows a value of $11,123 thousand for March 31, 2024, and $18,713 thousand for December 31, 2023.\n\nSince the question asks for the *beginning* balance for the period ending March 31, 2024, this would be the amount at the start of that period, which corresponds to December 31, 2023.\n\nTherefore, the beginning balance of cash and cash equivalents for Blue Dolphin Energy Co. is **$18,713** (in thousands)."

Question you need to answer: What is the capital surplus of AMERICAN SHARED HOSPITAL SERVICES?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents for American Shared Hospital Services (ASHS), specifically its condensed consolidated statement of shareholders' equity on page 20, we can determine the capital surplus.\n\nThe statement of shareholders' equity shows the following components:\n- Common Stock\n- Additional Paid-in Capital\n- Retained Earnings\n- Non-controlling Interests in Subsidiaries\n\nThere is no line item explicitly labeled \"Capital Surplus\" or a similar term such as \"Paid-in Excess\" or \"Additional Paid-In Capital\". The amount that would typically be considered capital surplus is often included within \"Additional Paid-in Capital\".\n\nLooking at the structure of the statement, the \"Additional Paid-in Capital\" account represents the excess amount received from investors over the par value of the stock issued. This is the closest equivalent to \"capital surplus\" in standard accounting terminology.\n\nTherefore, the capital surplus of American Shared Hospital Services is represented by the **Additional Paid-in Capital** account, which has a balance of $8,330,000 as of March 31, 2024."

However, the note to the financial statements on page 5 (image 39) clarifies that \"Restricted cash\" is included in the total cash and cash equivalents. Therefore, the total cash and cash equivalents should be calculated as $11,462 + $5,000 = $16,462 thousand, matching the cash flow statement.\n\n4.  **CPI Aerostructures, Inc. (Form 10-Q):**\n    -   The balance sheet on page 6 (image 40) reports \"Cash\" at the end of the period as $3,018,068 thousand.\n    -   This is also confirmed in the cash flow statement on page 6 (image 40).\n\nComparing these values:\n- ClearOne, Inc.: $18,544 thousand\n- Dominari Holdings Inc.: $1,956 thousand\n- Dawson Geophysical Company: $16,462 thousand\n- CPI Aerostructures, Inc.: $3,018,068 thousand\n\nThe value for CPI Aerostructures, Inc. ($3,018,068 thousand) is significantly higher than all others.\n\nTherefore, the company with the highest 'Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period' is **CPI Aerostructures, Inc.**"

If the question involves content not found in the financial statements, you may ignore this part and only answer the other parts.\n\nDocuments needed to answer the question are provided as images. Question you need to answer: Which company has the lowest 'Total Liabilities'?",
    "answer": "To determine which company has the lowest 'Total Liabilities', we must examine the condensed consolidated balance sheets for each company presented in the documents.\n\n1.  **Dawson Geophysical Company (Image 3 & 4):**\n    -   The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on image 4 shows \"Total liabilities and stockholders' equity\" amounting to $57,780 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n    -   This figure represents total liabilities plus shareholders' equity. Since it is a balance sheet, Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity.\n    -   From image 3, Total Assets for March 31, 2024, were also $57,780 thousand.\n    -   Therefore, Total Liabilities = Total Assets - Shareholders' Equity.\n    -   Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2024, was $27,260 thousand (image 4).\n    -   So, Total Liabilities = $57,780 - $27,260 = $30,520 thousand.\n\n2.  **Dominari Holdings Inc. (Images 30-31):**\n    -   The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on image 31 shows \"Total liabilities and stockholders’ equity\" of $52,194 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n    -   Total Assets for March 31, 2024, were $52,194 thousand (image 30).\n    -   Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2024, was $47,669 thousand (image 31).\n    -   So, Total Liabilities = $52,194 - $47,669 = $4,525 thousand.\n\n3.  **Equus Total Return, Inc. (Images 50-51):**\n    -   The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on image 51 shows \"Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity\" of $99,139 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n    -   Total Assets for March 31, 2024, were $99,139 thousand (image 50).\n    -   Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2024, was $45,892 thousand (image 51).\n    -   So, Total Liabilities = $99,139 - $45,892 = $53,247 thousand.\n\n4.  **ClearOne, Inc. (Images 88-89):**\n    -   The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on image 89 shows \"Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity\" of $48,211 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n    -   Total Assets for March 31, 2024, were $48,211 thousand (image 88).\n    -   Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2024, was $28,344 thousand (image 89).\n    -   So, Total Liabilities = $48,211 - $28,344 = $19,867 thousand.\n\n5.  **American Shared Hospital Services (Images 100-101):**\n    -   The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet on image 101 shows \"Total liabilities and shareholders’ equity\" of $50,124,000 for March 31, 2024.\n    -   Total Assets for March 31, 2024, were $50,124,000 (image 100).\n    -   Shareholders' Equity at March 31, 2024, was $26,385,000 (image 101).\n    -   So, Total Liabilities = $50,124,000 - $26,385,000 = $23,739,000.\n\nComparing the calculated Total Liabilities:\n-   Dawson Geophysical Company: $30,520 thousand\n-   Dominari Holdings Inc.: $4,525 thousand\n-   Equus Total Return, Inc.: $53,247 thousand\n-   ClearOne, Inc.: $19,867 thousand\n-   American Shared Hospital Services: $23,739,000\n\nThe lowest value is $4,525 thousand, which belongs to **Dominari Holdings Inc.**\n\nTherefore, the company with the lowest 'Total Liabilities' is Dominari Holdings Inc."

If the question involves content not found in the financial statements, you may ignore this part and only answer the other parts.\n\nDocuments needed to answer the question are provided as images. Question you need to answer: Which company has the highest 'Total Non-current Assets'?",
    "answer": "To determine which company has the highest 'Total Non-current Assets', we must examine the consolidated balance sheets for each company presented in the documents.\n\n1.  **Hugoton Royalty Trust (Page 2):** The condensed financial statements show a line item \"Net profits interests in oil and gas properties - net\" with a value of $120,303 for March 31, 2024. This is the only non-current asset listed. There is no separate line item labeled \"Total Non-current Assets\". Therefore, its total non-current assets can be considered to be approximately $120,303.\n\n2.  **BioLargo, Inc. (Pages 11-12):** The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets on page 12 list \"Other non-current assets\" totaling $70,000 for March 31, 2024. This includes items like investment in joint venture ($18,000) and right-of-use operating lease ($1,068,000). However, these figures appear to be misaligned or incorrectly formatted. Looking at the table structure, it seems that \"Investment in South Korean joint venture\" and \"Right of use, operating lease, net of amortization\" are both under the \"Other non-current assets\" category. Summing them up gives us $18,000 + $1,068,000 = $1,086,000. But this contradicts the figure shown for \"Other non-current assets\" which is $70,000. Given the inconsistency, we should rely on the most direct calculation from the table. The table shows \"Other non-current assets\" as $70,000. We will take this as the total non-current assets for BioLargo.\n\n3.  **Blue Dolphin Energy Company (Page 8):** The Consolidated Balance Sheet on page 9 lists \"Long-term assets\" including \"Total property and equipment, net\" ($54,316), \"Operating lease right-of-use assets, net\" ($100), \"Restricted cash, noncurrent\" ($1,000), \"Surety bonds\" ($230), and \"Deferred tax assets, net\" ($-). Adding these together: $54,316 + $100 + $1,000 + $230 + (-$-) = $55,646. This represents the total long-term assets, which is equivalent to total non-current assets.\n\nComparing the three:\n- Hugoton Royalty Trust: ~$120,303\n- BioLargo, Inc.: $70,000\n- Blue Dolphin Energy Company: $55,646\n\nThe Hugoton Royalty Trust has the highest total non-current assets.\n\nTherefore, the company with the highest 'Total Non-current Assets' is **Hugoton Royalty Trust**."

Question you need to answer: Which company has the lowest 'Operating and Administrative Expenses'?",
    "answer": "To determine which company has the lowest operating and administrative expenses, we must examine the financial statements for each listed company and identify their respective \"General and Administrative Expenses\" or similar line items, which typically constitute a major portion of operating and administrative costs.\n\n1.  **COYNI, INC. (Image 3):**\n    -   The \"Statements of Operations\" show \"General and administrative expenses\" for the three months ended March 31, 2024, were $29,526.\n    -   For the same period in 2023, these expenses were $54,524.\n    -   This is the lowest value among all companies reviewed.\n\n2.  **BIOETHICS, LTD. (Image 23):**\n    -   The \"Condensed Statements of Operations\" list \"General and administrative\" expenses for Q1 2024 at $27,221.\n    -   For Q1 2023, it was $12,027.\n    -   While lower than COYNI's 2023 figure, it is higher than COYNI's 2024 figure.\n\n3.  **ASPIRA WOMEN'S HEALTH INC. (Image 38):**\n    -   The \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations\" report \"General and administrative\" expenses for Q1 2024 at $3,604 thousand (or $3,604,000).\n    -   For Q1 2023, it was $3,604 thousand (or $3,604,000) — wait, let me recheck.\n    -   Actually, looking at page 39, under \"General and administrative,\" the expense for 2024 is $3,604 thousand, and for 2023 it is also $3,604 thousand? No, that can't be right. Let me check again.\n    -   On page 39, the table shows:\n        -   2024: General and administrative = $3,604\n        -   2023: General and administrative = $3,604\n    -   Wait, this seems incorrect. Looking back at page 39, the table says \"General and administrative\" for 2024 is $3,604 and for 2023 is $3,604. But then on page 40, it says \"General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2024 decreased by $475,000, or 13%, compared to the same period in 2023.\" This implies the 2023 amount was higher. There appears to be an error in the document. However, even if we assume the 2023 figure was $3,604 + $475,000 = $4,079,000, it would still be significantly higher than COYNI's $29,526.\n\n4.  **HARTE HANKS, INC. (Image 48):**\n    -   The \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss\" show \"Operating expenses\" for Q1 2024 at $45,073.\n    -   For Q1 2023, it was $46,067.\n    -   This is much higher than COYNI's figures.\n\n5.  **ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC. (Image 65):**\n    -   The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" report \"Selling, general and administrative\" expenses for Q1 2024 at $28,371 thousand ($28,371,000).\n    -   For Q1 2023, it was $22,514 thousand ($22,514,000).\n    -   Again, this is substantially higher than COYNI's $29,526.\n\nComparing the values:\n\n-   COYNI, INC.: $29,526\n-   BIOETHICS, LTD.: $27,221 (Q1 2024)\n-   ASPIRA WOMEN'S HEALTH INC.: $3,604,000 (Q1 2024) — but this is likely a misprint; the text on page 39 states \"General and administrative expenses... decreased by $475,000, or 13%\". Assuming the 2023 figure was $4,079,000, it is still far higher than COYNI's.\n-   HARTE HANKS, INC.: $45,073\n-   ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.: $28,371,000\n\nEven though Bioethics' Q1 2024 expense is slightly lower than COYNI's, COYNI's total operating and administrative expenses for the quarter are clearly the lowest when comparing the absolute dollar amounts across all companies.\n\nTherefore, the company with the lowest operating and administrative expenses is **COYNI, INC.**"

Question you need to answer: How many companies have 'Total Shares Outstanding' exceeding 10,000,000 shares?",
    "answer": "To determine how many companies have a 'Total Shares Outstanding' exceeding 10,000,000 shares, we must examine the condensed consolidated balance sheets or related equity sections for each company presented in the documents.\n\nThe relevant data is found in the \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity\" or similar sections for each entity:\n\n1.  **COYNI, INC.** (Pages 4-5)\n    - The statement of changes in stockholders' deficit shows that at March 31, 2024, there were 101,301,968 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number exceeds 10,000,000.\n\n2.  **HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST** (Page 5)\n    - The document states: “As of May 2, 2024, the registrant had 40,000,000 units of beneficial interest outstanding.”\n    - While it uses the term \"units,\" in the context of a royalty trust, these represent ownership interests equivalent to shares. Since 40,000,000 > 10,000,000, this company qualifies.\n\n3.  **ASPIRA WOMEN’S HEALTH INC.** (Page 37)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet indicates that as of March 31, 2024, there were 12,344,104 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number exceeds 10,000,000.\n\n4.  **1ST FRANKLIN FINANCIAL CORPORATION** (Page 32)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet shows that as of March 31, 2024, there were 170,000 voting shares and 168,300 non-voting shares outstanding.\n    - Total = 170,000 + 168,300 = 338,300 shares.\n    - This number does NOT exceed 10,000,000.\n\n5.  **ASCENT INDUSTRIES CO.** (Page 30)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet shows that as of March 31, 2024, there were 11,085,103 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number exceeds 10,000,000.\n\n6.  **DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC.** (Page 20)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet shows that as of March 31, 2024, there were 5,995,065 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number does NOT exceed 10,000,000.\n\n7.  **GRESHAM WORLDWIDE, INC.** (Page 20)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet shows that as of March 31, 2024, there were 7,931,602 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number does NOT exceed 10,000,000.\n\n8.  **CIRTRAN CORPORATION** (Page 20)\n    - The condensed consolidated balance sheet shows that as of March 31, 2024, there were 4,945,417 shares issued and outstanding.\n    - This number does NOT exceed 10,000,000.\n\nCounting the companies with total shares outstanding exceeding 10,000,000:\n- COYNI, INC.\n- HUGOTON ROYALTY TRUST\n- ASPIRA WOMEN’S HEALTH INC.\n- ASCENT INDUSTRIES CO.\n\nThis gives us a total of 4 companies.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 4."

Question you need to answer: Which company has the lowest Net Profit?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents, we can analyze the net profit (or net loss) for each company's three-month period ended March 31, 2024.\n\n- **General Enterprise Ventures, Inc.:** The Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss (page 5) shows a \"Net Loss\" of $(3,519,710). This is equivalent to a negative net profit.\n- **AIM Immunotech Inc.:** The Consolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Deficit (pages 6-7) show a \"Net loss\" of $(3,519,710) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This matches the figure for General Enterprise Ventures, Inc., indicating they both had identical losses.\n- **Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership:** The Condensed Statements of Income (page 10) report a \"NET (LOSS) INCOME\" of $(4,605) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This represents a smaller loss than the others.\n- **Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc.:** The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (page 18) show a \"Net loss\" of $(27,954) for the same period.\n- **Biologo, Inc.:** The Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations (page 30) report a \"Net loss\" of $(775) for the three months ended March 31, 2024. This is the smallest absolute value among all the reported losses.\n\nComparing these figures:\n- Biologo, Inc. had a net loss of $775.\n- Global Clean Energy Holdings, Inc. had a net loss of $27,954.\n- Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership had a net loss of $4,605.\n- AIM Immunotech Inc. and General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. both had a net loss of $3,519,710.\n\nSince the question asks for the company with the *lowest* net profit, and all companies reported a net loss (a negative number), the one with the least negative value (i.e., closest to zero) has the highest net profit (which is still negative).\n\nTherefore, Biologo, Inc. has the lowest net loss amount, which means it also has the highest net profit among the listed companies, even though it is still a negative figure.\n\nThe company with the lowest net profit (the most negative) is General Enterprise Ventures, Inc. or AIM Immunotech Inc., both reporting a net loss of $3,519,710.\n\nHowever, if the question intends to find the company with the *least negative* net profit (i.e., the best performance), then Biologo, Inc. is correct.\n\nGiven the phrasing \"lowest Net Profit,\" which typically implies the most negative value, the answer should be the company with the largest net loss.\n\n**Final Answer:**\nGeneral Enterprise Ventures, Inc. and AIM Immunotech Inc. both have the lowest net profit (a net loss of $3,519,710), which is lower than any other company's reported loss."

    "answer": "根据提供的财务报告内容，无法确定每个公司“未分配利润”的具体数值。\n\n原因如下：\n1.  **数据缺失**：在所有提供的文档中，均未出现名为“未分配利润”或类似会计科目的明细数据。\n2.  **信息类型不符**：所提供的文件主要包含的是资产负债表（如总资产、总负债）、利润表（如营业收入、净利润）以及现金流量表等项目的数据，但并未列出股东权益下的“未分配利润”这一特定科目。\n3.  **格式限制**：虽然文档中包含了大量数字和百分比，但这些数据与“未分配利润”无直接关联，无法从中推断出该科目的值。\n\n因此，基于现有材料，无法回答此问题。"

    "answer": "根据提供的多份财务报告内容，无法确定“合同负债”最高的公司。\n\n原因如下：\n1.  在所有提供的文档中，均未出现“合同负债”这一具体会计科目的名称或其对应的数值。\n2.  报告中提及了“预收款项”，但这是与“合同负债”不同的科目。“预收款项”在报告中被多次列出，例如在第0页、第5页和第16页等处，其金额为 `1,349,784.00` 或 `1,349,784.00` 等，但这并非“合同负债”。\n3.  “合同负债”是一个更现代的会计准则下的科目，用于反映企业因销售商品或提供服务而收到的、尚未履行履约义务的款项。虽然它可能与“预收款项”有重叠，但在这些报告中并未明确区分或直接给出“合同负债”的数据。\n\n因此，基于现有信息，无法回答哪个公司的“合同负债”最高。"

If the question involves content not found in the financial statements, you may ignore this part and only answer the other parts.\n\nDocuments needed to answer the question are provided as images. Question you need to answer: Please list the 'Total Shares Outstanding' of each of the aforementioned companies in ascending order.",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents, here is a list of the \"Total Shares Outstanding\" for each company, presented in ascending order:\n\n1.  **Ascent Industries Co.**: The document does not provide a specific number for total shares outstanding. It lists common stock issued and outstanding as 11,085, but it also has treasury stock (960 shares). The total shareholders’ equity section shows a balance of $101,964, which includes the common stock and retained earnings, but does not explicitly state the total shares outstanding after accounting for treasury stock. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact total shares outstanding from the given data.\n2.  **Blue Dolphin Energy Company**: The document states that there were 14,921,968 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2024. This figure represents the total shares outstanding.\n3.  **Broad Street Realty, Inc.**: The document indicates that as of May 8, 2024, the registrant had 34,325,565 shares of common stock outstanding.\n4.  **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust**: The document states that as of May 2, 2024, there were 6,000,000 units of beneficial interest outstanding. While these are referred to as “units,” they functionally represent the equivalent of shares in a trust structure. For comparison purposes, we will treat them as the unit count.\n5.  **1st Franklin Financial Corporation**: The document provides two figures for shares outstanding:\n    *   Voting Common Stock: 1,700 shares\n    *   Non-Voting Common Stock: 168,300 shares\n    *   Total = 1,700 + 168,300 = 169,000 shares\n\nArranging these values in ascending order:\n\n- Ascent Industries Co.: Not determinable from the provided data.\n- Cross Timbers Royalty Trust: 6,000,000 units\n- 1st Franklin Financial Corporation: 169,000 shares\n- Blue Dolphin Energy Company: 14,921,968 shares\n- Broad Street Realty, Inc.: 34,325,565 shares\n\nTherefore, the final ordered list is:\n\n**Ascent Industries Co. (Not Determinable), Cross Timbers Royalty Trust (6,000,000), 1st Franklin Financial Corporation (169,000), Blue Dolphin Energy Company (14,921,968), Broad Street Realty, Inc. (34,325,565)**"

Based on standard accounting practices and the context of these companies, it's more likely that these entities should be categorized under \"Medium Liabilities\" given their total current liabilities exceed $10 million but are less than $50 million. However, since the instruction requires strict adherence to the specified thresholds, they are placed in the \"Very Low Liabilities\" group as per the numerical values presented. This discrepancy highlights an inconsistency in the data or its presentation. For practical purposes, these four companies would typically be classified as having \"Medium Liabilities\"."

    "answer": "Based on the condensed consolidated balance sheets presented in the documents, here is the categorization of the companies by their current assets at March 31, 2024:\n\n**Very High Assets (Over $50,000,000):**\n- **CPI AEROSTRUCTURES, INC.**: Current assets were $43,875,506.\n- **THE ARENA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.**: Current assets were $43,168,000.\n- **DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL COMPANY**: Current assets were $38,193,000.\n- **COYNI, INC.**: Current assets were $1,261,000.\n\n*Note: CPI Aerostructures, The Arena Group Holdings, and Dawson Geophysical all fall within the \"very high\" range.

Let's correct this based on a more precise reading of the figures.\n\nThe correct categorization is as follows:\n\n**Very High Assets (Over $50,000,000):**\n- **CPI AEROSTRUCTURES, INC.**: $43,875,506 — This is actually less than $50M, so it should be categorized as \"High\".\n- **THE ARENA GROUP HOLDINGS, INC.**: $43,168,000 — Also less than $50M, so \"High\".\n- **DAWSON GEOPHYSICAL COMPANY**: $38,193,000 — Less than $50M, so \"High\".\n\nActually, none of these three exceed $50M. Therefore, no company falls into the \"Very High Assets\" category.\n\n**High Assets (Over $10,000,000 and Below $50,000,000):**\n- **Blue Dolphin Energy Company**: $11,123,000 — Fits perfectly.\n- **CirTran Corporation**: $1,561,494 — Does NOT fit; it’s under $10M.\n- **Coyni, Inc.**: $1,261,000 — Does NOT fit.\n\nSo, only Blue Dolphin Energy Company fits in the \"High Assets\" category.\n\n**Medium Assets (Above $1,000,000 and Below $10,000,000):**\n- **CirTran Corporation**: $1,561,494 — Fits.\n- **Coyni, Inc.**: $1,261,000 — Fits.\n\n**Low Assets (Above $100,000 and Below $1,000,000):**\n- None of the companies listed fit this category.\n\n**Very Low Assets ($100,000 and Below):**\n- None of the companies listed fit this category.\n\n---\n\n**Final Corrected Categorization:**\n\n**High Assets (Over $10,000,000 and Below $50,000,000):**\n- Blue Dolphin Energy Company\n\n**Medium Assets (Above $1,000,000 and Below $10,000,000):**\n- CirTran Corporation\n- Coyni, Inc.\n\nNo companies fall into the \"Very High\", \"Low\", or \"Very Low\" asset categories based on the data provided."

Place companies into the same collection for the same category and into different collections for different categories.",
    "answer": "Based on the financial statements provided, here is the categorization of the companies by their Total Liabilities:\n\n**High Liabilities (Over $1,000,000.00):**\n- Broadway Financial Corporation: Total liabilities were $1,088,997 thousand ($1.088 billion) as of March 31, 2024.\n- Ault Alliance, Inc.: Total liabilities were $299,777,000 as of March 31, 2024.\n- AIM Immunotech Inc.: Total liabilities were $16,189 thousand as of March 31, 2024.\n- BIOLARGO, INC.: Total liabilities were $4,673 thousand as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Medium Liabilities (Over $100,000.00 and Below $1,000,000.00):**\n- Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership: Total liabilities were $296,746 thousand as of March 31, 2024.\n\n**Low Liabilities (Below $100,000.00):**\n- BIOETHICS, LTD.: Total liabilities were $816,011 thousand as of March 31, 2024.\n\nNote: The liability amounts for some entities appear to be reported in thousands or millions, so they must be interpreted accordingly. For example, \"Total liabilities\" for Broadway Financial Corporation was stated as \"$1,088,997\", which implies $1,088,997,000 when considering it's a large corporation with assets in billions. Similarly, for Ault Alliance, Inc., the total liabilities were $299,777,000. However, for smaller entities like BIOETHICS, LTD., the amount appears to be in thousands, making its total liabilities $816,011,000. This interpretation aligns with standard reporting practices where figures are often presented in thousands unless otherwise specified. Therefore, all these values exceed $100,000.00 and should fall under either High or Medium categories. Upon re-evaluation, it seems that the correct categorization should be based on the actual dollar value after converting from thousands if necessary. Let's reassess using consistent units.\n\nRevised Categorization:\nAssuming all figures are in thousands (as indicated by \"(in thousands)\" in several tables):\n\n- Broadway Financial Corporation: $1,088,997 → $1,088,997,000 → **High**\n- Ault Alliance, Inc.: $299,777 → $299,777,000 → **High**\n- AIM Immunotech Inc.: $16,189 → $16,189,000 → **High**\n- BIOLARGO, INC.: $4,673 → $4,673,000 → **High**\n\nDivall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership: $296,746 → $296,746,000 → **High**\n\nBIOETHICS, LTD.: $816,011 → $816,011,000 → **High**\n\nUpon reviewing again, I realize there might be an error in my initial assessment. Looking at the specific documents, for instance, the condensed balance sheet for Bioethics, Ltd. shows total liabilities of $816,011, which is clearly over $1,000,000.00. All the listed companies have liabilities well above $100,000.00. There are no companies with liabilities below $100,000.00 according to the data provided.\n\nTherefore, the final categorization is:\n\n**High Liabilities (Over $1,000,000.00):**\n- Broadway Financial Corporation\n- Ault Alliance, Inc.\n- AIM Immunotech Inc.\n- BIOLARGO, INC.\n- Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership\n- BIOETHICS, LTD.\n\nThere are no companies in the \"Medium\" or \"Low\" liability categories based on the provided financial statements."

All other companies have liabilities that are either below $100,000 or zero, which does not fit any of the specified categories except \"Low Liabilities\" or \"No Liabilities\", but since none meet the criteria for those, they are left unclassified according to the given instructions. However, if we strictly follow the instruction to place them into a collection for each category, then all companies with liabilities between $100,000 and $10,000,000 would go into the \"Medium Liabilities\" group, and those with liabilities between $0 and $100,000 would go into the \"Low Liabilities\" group. Since no company has liabilities in the range of $100,000 to $10,000,000, there are no companies in the \"Medium Liabilities\" group. Similarly, no company has liabilities in the range of $0 to $100,000, so there are no companies in the \"Low Liabilities\" group. Therefore, the correct categorization is:\n- High Liabilities: AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC., HARTE HANKS, INC., DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC., ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC., EQUUS TOTAL RETURN, INC.\n- Medium Liabilities: GRANT PARK FUTURES FUND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\n- Low Liabilities: None\n- No Liabilities: None\n\nHowever, upon re-evaluation, the liability amounts for most companies do not match the thresholds defined for the \"Medium Liabilities\" and \"Low Liabilities\" categories. For example, the liabilities for AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC. ($14,168,187) and others are well over $10,000,000, placing them in the \"High Liabilities\" group. The liability for GRANT PARK FUTURES FUND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP ($32,412,186) also exceeds $10,000,000, so it belongs in the \"High Liabilities\" group as well. There are no companies with liabilities between $100,000 and $10,000,000, nor any with liabilities between $0 and $100,000. Thus, the final categorization is:\n\n**High Liabilities (Over $10,000,000):**\n- AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC.\n- HARTE HANKS, INC.\n- DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC.\n- ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.\n- EQUUS TOTAL RETURN, INC.\n- GRANT PARK FUTURES FUND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\n\n**Medium Liabilities (Over $100,000 and Below $10,000,000):**\n- None\n\n**Low Liabilities (Above $0 and Below $100,000):**\n- None\n\n**No Liabilities (0 and Below):**\n- None"

However, the document does not provide a line item specifically labeled \"Operating and Administrative Expenses\".

However, given that its general and admin expenses are low, and assuming \"Operating and Administrative Expenses\" refers broadly to operational costs, it falls into the lowest bracket if we consider the available data.\n    -   **Category**: Low expenses.\n\n4.  **ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC.**:\n    -   The consolidated statements of operations on page 26 show total operating expenses of $39,917.\n    -   This amount is between $100,000 and $1,000,000.\n    -   **Category**: Medium expenses.\n\n5.  **DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC.**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements of operations on page 17 show total operating expenses of $4,172.\n    -   This amount is between $100,000 and $1,000,000.\n    -   **Category**: Medium expenses.\n\n6.  **EQUUS TOTAL RETURN, INC.**:\n    -   The condensed statements of operations on page 18 show total operating expenses of $1,373.\n    -   This amount is between $100,000 and $1,000,000.\n    -   **Category**: Medium expenses.\n\n---\n\n**Final Categorization:**\n\n-   **High expenses (over 1,000,000)**: AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC.\n-   **Medium expenses (over 100,000 and below 1,000,000)**: HARTE HANKS, INC., ACORDA THERAPEUTICS, INC., DOMINARI HOLDINGS INC., EQUUS TOTAL RETURN, INC.\n-   **Low expenses (above 0 and below 100,000)**: GRANT PARK FUTURES FUND LIMITED PARTNERSHIP\n-   **No expenses (0)**: None of the companies reported zero expenses."

    "answer": "Based on the financial statements provided, here is the categorization of the companies by their \"Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period\":\n\n**High Cash (Over $10,000,000):**\n- **Broadway Financial Corporation**: $67,122 thousand ($67.122 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $1,360 thousand ($1.36 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **ClearOne, Inc.**: $18,544 thousand ($18.544 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **American Shared Hospital Services**: $12,792,000 — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **BioLargo, Inc.**: $4,336 thousand ($4.336 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **Bioethics, Ltd.**: $93 thousand — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n\nNone of the companies listed have \"Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period\" over $10,000,000.\n\n**Medium Cash (Over $1,000,000 and Up to $10,000,000):**\n- **Broadway Financial Corporation**: $67,122 thousand ($67.122 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $1,360 thousand ($1.36 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **ClearOne, Inc.**: $18,544 thousand ($18.544 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **American Shared Hospital Services**: $12,792,000 — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **BioLargo, Inc.**: $4,336 thousand ($4.336 million) — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n- **Bioethics, Ltd.**: $93 thousand — This amount is less than $10 million, so it does not qualify.\n\nNone of the companies listed have \"Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period\" between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000.\n\n**Low Cash (Above $0 and Up to $1,000,000):**\n- **Broadway Financial Corporation**: $67,122 thousand ($67.122 million) — This amount is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, so it qualifies.\n- **GSE Systems, Inc.**: $1,360 thousand ($1.36 million) — This amount is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, so it qualifies.\n- **ClearOne, Inc.**: $18,544 thousand ($18.544 million) — This amount is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, so it qualifies.\n- **American Shared Hospital Services**: $12,792,000 — This amount is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, so it qualifies.\n- **BioLargo, Inc.**: $4,336 thousand ($4.336 million) — This amount is greater than $1,000,000 but less than $10,000,000, so it qualifies.\n- **Bioethics, Ltd.**: $93 thousand — This amount is less than $1,000,000, so it does not qualify.\n\nThe companies that fall into the \"Low Cash\" category are:\n- Broadway Financial Corporation\n- GSE Systems, Inc.\n- ClearOne, Inc.\n- American Shared Hospital Services\n- BioLargo, Inc.\n\n**No Cash (0 or Below):**\n- **Bioethics, Ltd.**: $93 thousand — This amount is greater than 0, so it does not qualify.\n\nNone of the companies listed have \"Cash and Cash Equivalents at End of Period\" equal to 0 or below.\n\nIn summary, the categorization is as follows:\n\n- High Cash: None\n- Medium Cash: None\n- Low Cash: Broadway Financial Corporation, GSE Systems, Inc., ClearOne, Inc., American Shared Hospital Services, BioLargo, Inc.\n- No Cash: None\n\nNote: The amounts presented in the financial statements are typically in thousands unless otherwise specified. For example, if a company has $18,544 thousand, it means $18,544,000. However, since none of the values exceed $10,000,000, they do not meet the criteria for \"High Cash\". Similarly, all values except those from Bioethics, Ltd. are above $1,000,000, placing them in the \"Low Cash\" category."

    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents, here is the categorization of the cash and cash equivalents balances for each company:\n\n**High Balance (Over $1,000,000):**\n- **Broad Street Realty, Inc.:** $14,631 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $14,631,000, which exceeds $1,000,000.\n- **1st Franklin Financial Corporation:** $21,411,563 (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount exceeds $1,000,000.\n- **GSE Systems, Inc.:** $1,360 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $1,360,000, which exceeds $1,000,000.\n- **ClearOne, Inc.:** $18,544 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $18,544,000, which exceeds $1,000,000.\n\n**Medium Balance (Over $100,000 and Up to $1,000,000):**\n- **BioLargo, Inc.:** $4,336 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $4,336,000, which falls within the specified range.\n- **American Shared Hospital Services:** $12,792,000 (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $12,792,000, which exceeds $1,000,000, so it belongs in the High Balance group.\n- **Biolargo, Inc.:** $4,336 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $4,336,000, which falls within the specified range.\n- **Cross Timbers Royalty Trust:** The document does not provide a specific value for \"Cash and short-term investments\" or \"Cash and cash equivalents\" for Cross Timbers Royalty Trust; therefore, it cannot be categorized.\n\n**Low Balance (Above $0 to $100,000):**\n- **BIOETHICS, LTD.:** $93 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $93,000, which falls within the specified range.\n- **BIOLARGO, INC.:** $4,336 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $4,336,000, which exceeds $1,000,000, so it belongs in the High Balance group.\n- **BROADWAY FINANCIAL CORPORATION:** $67,122 thousand (as of March 31, 2024) — This amount is $67,122,000, which exceeds $1,000,000, so it belongs in the High Balance group.\n- **CROSS TIMBERS ROYALTY TRUST:** The document does not provide a specific value for \"Cash and short-term investments\" or \"Cash and cash equivalents\" for Cross Timbers Royalty Trust; therefore, it cannot be categorized.\n\n**No Balance ($0 and Below):**\n- None of the companies listed have a reported cash and cash equivalent balance of $0 or below.\n\nIn summary:\n- **High Balance Group:** Broad Street Realty, Inc., 1st Franklin Financial Corporation, GSE Systems, Inc., ClearOne, Inc.\n- **Medium Balance Group:** BioLargo, Inc.\n- **Low Balance Group:** BIOETHICS, LTD.\n- **No Balance Group:** None\n\nNote: Some companies were incorrectly placed in multiple categories due to misinterpretation of their values. Upon re-evaluation, American Shared Hospital Services has a balance of $12,792,000, which should be classified under High Balance. Similarly, Broadway Financial Corporation's balance of $67,122,000 also qualifies as High Balance. Therefore, these two companies belong in the High Balance group. The correct categorizations are as follows:\n\n**High Balance (Over $1,000,000):**\n- Broad Street Realty, Inc.\n- 1st Franklin Financial Corporation\n- GSE Systems, Inc.\n- ClearOne, Inc.\n- American Shared Hospital Services\n- Broadway Financial Corporation\n\n**Medium Balance (Over $100,000 and Up to $1,000,000):**\n- BioLargo, Inc.\n\n**Low Balance (Above $0 to $100,000):**\n- BIOETHICS, LTD.\n\n**No Balance ($0 and Below):**\n- None\n\nThis corrected categorization ensures that each company is placed in only one appropriate category based on its cash and cash equivalents balance."

    "answer": "根据提供的多份公司财务报告内容，我们无法完整地提取所有公司的“营业利润”数据进行分类。原因如下：\n\n1.  **数据缺失**：在所提供的文档中，虽然多次提到了“营业利润”或类似名称（如“营业利润总额”、“营业利润”），但其具体的数值并未以清晰、可读的方式呈现。例如，在第6页和第7页等位置，可以看到“营业利润”字样，但紧接着是大量被替换为乱码或不完整的数字，无法从中准确识别出具体金额。\n2.  **格式混乱**：许多页面上的数据是以表格形式展示的，但由于OCR识别错误或原始文件损坏，导致关键的财务数据字段（特别是“营业利润”）被破坏或丢失。\n3.  **信息不全**：即使在某些页面上能看到一些看似像数字的数据，它们也缺乏上下文，无法确认是否代表“营业利润”，也无法判断其所属的具体公司。\n\n因此，基于现有材料，无法对这些公司按“营业利润”进行高、中、低、负四个等级的划分。所有相关数据均不可用或无法可靠解读。"

    "answer": "根据提供的多份公司财务报告内容，我们可以通过分析其中“利润总额”的数值来对其进行分类。需要注意的是，由于文档中的数据是加密或乱码形式（例如大量使用了方框和符号），我们无法直接读取具体的数字值。因此，基于现有信息，我们无法准确判断任何一家公司的利润总额是否达到“高利润”、“中利润”、“低利润”或“负利润”的标准。\n\n在所有提供的图像中，虽然有提及“利润总额”这一概念，并且在某些地方出现了类似“[1,000,000,000.00]”、“[100,000,000.00]”等格式的数据，但这些数据并未被明确标识为“利润总额”，也没有清晰地展示完整的、可识别的数值。此外，许多页面上的数字被遮挡或以不可读的形式呈现。\n\n综上所述，由于缺乏清晰、可读的“利润总额”数据，我们无法完成按“利润总额”进行划分的任务。\n\n**最终答案：**\n无法根据所提供的资料进行划分，因为缺少明确、可读的“利润总额”数据。"

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, it is not possible to determine the change in Total Shares Outstanding for Ascent Industries Co. from 2023 to 2024.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **The document covers two fiscal years:** The Form 10-K provides detailed financial data for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (the \"current\" report), and also includes a separate section for the prior year, which is the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022.\n2.  **No data for 2024 is available:** There is no financial statement or disclosure within these reports that presents data for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. The most recent data presented is for 2023.\n3.  **Share count is given for specific dates:** While the company does provide the number of shares outstanding at specific points in time (e.g., March 28, 2024, on page 1, and March 28, 2023, on page 72), these figures represent snapshots at those dates, not the total shares outstanding for an entire fiscal year. Furthermore, the 2024 figure is not derived from any calculation or comparison within the text.\n\nTherefore, without data for the 2024 fiscal year, we cannot calculate or deduce the change in Total Shares Outstanding between 2023 and 2024."

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, it is impossible to determine how Arvana Inc.'s Earnings per Share (EPS) changed from 2021 to 2024.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **The Documents Cover Different Periods:** The provided documents contain Form 10-K filings for different fiscal years.\n    *   One document covers the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 (pages 1-38).\n    *   Another document covers the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 (pages 1-30).\n    *   A third document covers the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 (pages 1-39).\n    *   There is no document that contains financial data for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.\n\n2.  **Earnings Per Share Data is Not Available for 2024:** While the 2021 and 2023 financial statements do include EPS figures (e.g., page F-3 for 2021 shows a net loss per common share of $0.25), there is no corresponding data for 2024 because no such report exists within the provided materials.\n\nTherefore, since the required data for the year 2024 is not present in any of the documents, the change in EPS cannot be calculated or determined."

Question you need to answer: What is the trend in ARVANA INC's share capital from 2021 to 2024?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents for Arvana Inc., we can analyze the trend in share capital by examining the \"Statements of Stockholders' Deficiency\" and related notes for each year.\n\nThe key data points for share capital (which includes common stock and additional paid-in capital) are as follows:\n\n- **December 31, 2021**: The total shareholders’ equity/deficit was a deficit of $3,340. This reflects the company’s net loss and lack of capital.\n- **December 31, 2022**: The total shareholders’ equity/deficit improved to a surplus of $142,365. This significant increase is primarily due to proceeds from issuing new shares and debt settlements.\n- **December 31, 2023**: The total shareholders’ equity/deficit became a deficit of $216,549. This represents a decline from the previous year, likely due to operating losses and asset impairment.\n- **April 5, 2024** (as of the latest report): The number of shares outstanding increased to 107,845,554. While the exact equity figure isn't provided for this date, the substantial increase in the number of shares indicates that the company has raised more capital through issuances or conversions.\n\nIn summary, the trend in Arvana Inc.'s share capital shows an initial improvement from 2021 to 2022, followed by a decline in 2023, with a continued increase in the number of shares outstanding as of April 2024."

Question you need to answer: What is the trend in ARVANA INC's net profit from 2021 through 2024 based on the annual reports?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided annual reports for Arvana Inc., we can analyze the net profit (or loss) trends for the years 2021 through 2024.\n\n- **2021**: The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, shows a \"Net Loss\" of $12,116,448.\n- **2022**: The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, shows a \"Net Loss\" of $151,396.\n- **2023**: The consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023, shows a \"Net Loss\" of $1,316,573.\n- **2024**: The most recent report available is for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, which covers data up to that point. There is no separate annual report or financial statement provided for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024. Therefore, there is no data for 2024.\n\nThe trend from 2021 to 2023 shows an improvement in profitability, measured by a reduction in the magnitude of the net loss:\n- 2021: Net Loss = $12,116,448\n- 2022: Net Loss = $151,396 (a significant decrease)\n- 2023: Net Loss = $1,316,573 (an increase compared to 2022)\n\nHowever, it is important to note that all figures represent losses, meaning the company has not yet achieved a net profit during this period. The trend is one of fluctuation rather than consistent growth toward profitability.\n\nIn summary, while the net loss decreased substantially from 2021 to 2022, it increased again in 2023. Data for 2024 is not available in the provided documents."

Question you need to answer: What significant change can be observed in the Share Capital of American Battery Materials, Inc. from the 2023 to the 2024 Annual Report?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents for American Battery Materials, Inc., a significant change in share capital is evident when comparing the 2023 and 2024 annual reports.\n\n1.  **2023 Annual Report (Page F-5):** The \"Issued and Outstanding Shares\" section states that as of April 1, 2024, there were 11,375,459 shares of common stock outstanding.\n    *   This date is after the end of the fiscal year (December 31, 2023), so it reflects the company's status at the beginning of its next reporting period.\n\n2.  **2024 Annual Report (Page 26):** The \"Issued and Outstanding Shares\" section states that as of April 1, 2024, there were 11,375,459 shares of common stock outstanding.\n    *   This is identical to the figure reported in the 2023 report.\n\nHowever, the key insight lies in understanding what happened between these dates. The 2024 Annual Report details several transactions that occurred during the year, including:\n*   On January 5, 2023, the company issued 12,281 shares upon warrant exercise.\n*   On January 31, 2023, the company issued 122,808 shares upon warrant exercise.\n*   On February 28, 2023, the company issued 8,987 shares upon warrant exercise.\n*   And many more issuances throughout the year.\n\nThe most significant event was the reverse stock split executed by the company on December 8, 2023, which was effective as of May 1, 2023. A reverse stock split reduces the number of shares outstanding while increasing the price per share proportionally. For example, a 1-for-300 reverse split means each shareholder receives one new share for every 300 old shares they held.\n\nTherefore, the significant change in share capital is not an increase or decrease in the total number of shares, but rather a structural reorganization through a reverse stock split. This action consolidated the existing shares into fewer, higher-priced shares, which is a standard corporate action to improve market perception and trading liquidity without changing the company's underlying value. The number of shares outstanding remained constant at 11,375,459 as of April 1, 2024, indicating that the reverse split had already been completed and reflected in the records before the 2024 report was filed."

Question you need to answer: What is the percentage increase in Non-current Assets from 2023 to 2024 according to AMERICAN BATTERY MATERIALS, INC.'s financial reports?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, there is no financial report for the year ended December 31, 2024. The most recent financial statements presented are for the years ended December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.\n\nThe Consolidated Balance Sheets for American Battery Materials, Inc., which are included in the document (pages F-3 and F-7), show the following values for Non-current Assets:\n\n*   **December 31, 2023:** $206,000\n*   **December 31, 2022:** $100,000\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase from 2022 to 2023:\n1.  Calculate the absolute increase: $206,000 - $100,000 = $106,000.\n2.  Divide the increase by the original value (2022): $106,000 / $100,000 = 1.06.\n3.  Convert to a percentage: 1.06 * 100% = 106%.\n\nTherefore, the percentage increase in Non-current Assets from 2022 to 2023 was 106%. However, since the question asks for the increase from 2023 to 2024, and no data for 2024 is available in the provided documents, it is impossible to determine the requested figure.\n\n**Answer**: The percentage increase cannot be determined because there is no financial data provided for the year ended December 31, 2024."

Question you need to answer: How did ADM ENDEAVORS, INC.'s operating profit trend from 2021 to 2024?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, it is impossible to determine the operating profit trend for ADM Endeavors, Inc. from 2021 to 2024.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1.  **Missing Data:** The company's annual reports cover fiscal years ending December 31st. The most recent report available is for the year ended December 31, 2023 (image 97). There is no report or data presented for the year 2024.\n2.  **Inconsistent Reporting Periods:** While some sections mention \"2024\" (e.g., image 56), these references pertain to future projections or planned activities, such as a new facility or an acquisition agreement dated April 27, 2023, which is expected to be completed by May 1, 2025. These are forward-looking statements, not historical financial results.\n3.  **No Financial Data for 2024:** No consolidated financial statements, including income statements with operating profit figures, are provided for the year 2024.\n\nTherefore, since there is no actual financial data for the year 2024 within the provided documents, we cannot analyze or describe any trend for that period. The available data only allows us to compare operating profits for 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\n**Operating Profit Trend (2021-2023):**\n*   **2021:** Operating Income was $715,076.\n*   **2022:** Operating Income was $353,044.\n*   **2023:** Operating Income was $91,884.\n\nThis shows a clear downward trend in operating profit over the three-year period. However, without data for 2024, we cannot complete the requested analysis."

Question you need to answer: What has been the trend in Basic Earnings Per Share for ADM ENDEAVORS, INC. from 2021 to 2024 according to their annual reports?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided annual reports for ADM Endeavors, Inc., we can analyze the trend in Basic Earnings Per Share (EPS) from 2021 to 2024 by examining the Consolidated Statements of Operations for each year.\n\n- **2021**: The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (image 10) show that the net income was $737,348. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for basic EPS is listed as 162,965,330. Therefore, the Basic EPS for 2021 is calculated as:\n  `Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding`\n  `= $737,348 / 162,965,330 ≈ $0.00`\n\n- **2022**: The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 (image 10) show a net loss of $(23,287). The weighted average number of shares outstanding for basic EPS is 149,390,176. Therefore, the Basic EPS for 2022 is:\n  `Basic EPS = Net Loss / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding`\n  `= -$23,287 / 149,390,176 ≈ $0.00` (rounded)\n\n- **2023**: The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022 (image 39) show a net income of $137,468. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for basic EPS is 155,574,554. Therefore, the Basic EPS for 2023 is:\n  `Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding`\n  `= $137,468 / 155,574,554 ≈ $0.00` (rounded)\n\n- **2024**: The \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 (image 39) show a net income of $137,468. The weighted average number of shares outstanding for basic EPS is 155,574,554. Therefore, the Basic EPS for 2024 is:\n  `Basic EPS = Net Income / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding`\n  `= $137,468 / 155,574,554 ≈ $0.00` (rounded)\n\nIn summary, the Basic Earnings Per Share for ADM Endeavors, Inc. has remained at approximately $0.00 for all four years from 2021 to 2024, indicating no positive earnings per share during this period."

Specifically:\n- From 2022 ($42,582) to 2023 ($7,376), there was a decline of $35,206.\n- From 2023 ($7,376) to 2024 ($42,582), there was an increase of $35,206.\n\nTherefore, the trend shows a sharp drop in 2023 and a full recovery in 2024, returning to the 2022 value."

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents for AMERICAN BATTERY MATERIALS, INC., we can analyze the net profit (or loss) trends for the years 2022 and 2023.\n\n1.  **For the year ended December 31, 2023:** The Consolidated Statements of Operations (F-4) show a \"Net Loss\" of $2,384,802.\n2.  **For the year ended December 31, 2022:** The same statement shows a \"Net Loss\" of $1,486,848.\n\nThe document does not contain any financial data for the year 2024. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the company's net profit or loss for that year.\n\nSince both reported figures are losses, the trend from 2022 to 2023 is an increase in the magnitude of the loss (from $1,486,848 to $2,384,802). However, because there is no data for 2024, we cannot establish a complete trend over the three-year period requested.\n\n**Answer**: The document provides data for 2022 and 2023, showing a worsening loss from $1,486,848 in 2022 to $2,384,802 in 2023.

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, we can analyze the net cash flow from operating activities for Ascent Industries Co. for the years 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\n1.  **For the year ended December 31, 2022:** The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (page 32) show that \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" was $5,577 thousand.\n2.  **For the year ended December 31, 2023:** The same statement (page 32) shows a \"Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\" of $(69,410) thousand. This represents a significant negative cash flow from operations, indicating a substantial outflow.\n3.  **For the year ended December 31, 2024:** The document does not contain any financial data or statements for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024.

Question you need to answer: What has been the trend in the Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) of ADM ENDEAVORS, INC. from 2020 to 2024?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents for ADM Endeavors, Inc., we can analyze the trend in Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from 2020 to 2024 by examining the consolidated statements of operations.\n\n1.  **2020:** The Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, show a net loss from continuing operations of $119,922. Since there was no net income, the diluted EPS would be $0.00.\n    - *Source:* Page 16, \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for 2020.\n\n2.  **2021:** The same statement shows a net income from continuing operations of $737,348. This resulted in a diluted EPS of $0.00, as the weighted average number of shares outstanding is very high relative to the profit.\n    - *Source:* Page 16, \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for 2021.\n\n3.  **2022:** The company reported a net income of $149,752. However, due to the large number of shares outstanding, the diluted EPS remained at $0.00.\n    - *Source:* Page 16, \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for 2022.\n\n4.  **2023:** The company recorded a net income of $137,468. Again, with a significant number of shares outstanding, the diluted EPS was $0.00.\n    - *Source:* Page 17, \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for 2023.\n\n5.  **2024:** The company's net income for the year was $137,468. Despite the positive earnings, the diluted EPS is still reported as $0.00.\n    - *Source:* Page 17, \"Consolidated Statements of Operations\" for 2024.\n\nIn summary, while the company experienced fluctuations in its net income over these years, the Diluted Earnings Per Share has consistently been $0.00 across all five years presented in the financial statements. This indicates that the company's profits were insufficient to generate any earnings per share when accounting for all potentially dilutive securities. Therefore, the trend is flat at zero."

Question you need to answer: How has ARVANA INC's Share Capital changed from 2019 to 2024, and what is the overall trend?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents for Arvana Inc., we can analyze the changes in share capital by examining the consolidated balance sheets and related notes for the years ended December 31, 2023 (the most recent year available) and comparing it with the data for 2019.\n\nThe key figures for \"Common stock\" and \"Additional paid-in capital\" are extracted from the balance sheets:\n\n- **As of December 31, 2023**:\n    - Common Stock: $107,847\n    - Additional Paid-in Capital: $36,490,304\n\n- **As of December 31, 2022**:\n    - Common Stock: $107,847\n    - Additional Paid-in Capital: $36,240,352\n\n- **As of December 31, 2019**:\n    - Common Stock: $1,034\n    - Additional Paid-in Capital: $21,283,517\n\nTo understand the change from 2019 to 2024, we must note that the document does not contain any financial statements or disclosures for the year ending December 31, 2024.

    "answer": "Based on the provided financial documents for Arvana Inc., we can analyze the trend of Current Assets from 2019 to 2024 by examining the Balance Sheets for each relevant year.\n\nThe data for Current Assets is available in the \"Balance Sheets\" section for the years ended December 31:\n\n- **December 31, 2019**: The balance sheet (page F-2) shows that Total assets were $2,346, which consisted solely of Cash. Therefore, Current Assets for 2019 were $2,346.\n- **December 31, 2020**: The balance sheet (page F-1) shows that Total assets were $4,994, consisting solely of Cash.

This is an increase, not a decrease.\n    -   From **2021 to 2022**: Increase ($9,152,725 - $8,150,616 = +$1,002,109). This is also an increase.\n    -   From **2022 to 2023**: Decrease ($9,152,725 - $3,373,471 = -$5,779,254). This is a significant drop.\n    -   From **2023 to 2024**: No change ($3,373,471 - $3,373,471 = $0).\n\n3.  **Conclusion:** The largest decrease occurred between 2022 and 2023, with a reduction of $5,779,254.\n\nTherefore, the year that saw the largest decrease in Total Current Liabilities compared to the previous year was **2023**."

This marks a significant turnaround, showing an increase for the first time since 2020.\n\nTherefore, the trend in the net increase (or decrease) in cash and cash equivalents for American Battery Materials, Inc. from 2020 to 2024 is as follows:\n\nFrom 2020 to 2023, there was a consistent decline in cash, with the amount of decrease shrinking slightly each year (from $910,709 in 2020 to $35,206 in 2023). In 2024, the company experienced a positive change, with a net increase in cash of $35,206. This represents a reversal of the previous four-year downward trend."

If the question involves content not found in the financial statements, you may ignore this part and only answer the other parts.\n\nDocuments needed to answer the question are provided as images. Question you need to answer: What is the trend in cash inflows from financing activities for American Battery Materials, Inc. from 2020 to 2024, and what is the percentage increase from 2020 to 2024?",
    "answer": "Based on the consolidated financial statements for American Battery Materials, Inc., specifically the \"Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" (pages F-5 through F-6), we can analyze the cash flows from financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.\n\nThe relevant data points are:\n\n*   **Year Ended December 31, 2020:** The net cash provided by financing activities was $945,000.\n*   **Year Ended December 31, 2021:** The net cash provided by financing activities was $2,349,000.\n*   **Year Ended December 31, 2022:** The net cash provided by financing activities was $2,349,000.\n*   **Year Ended December 31, 2023:** The net cash provided by financing activities was $2,349,000.\n\n**Trend Analysis:**\n\nFrom 2020 to 2021, there was a significant increase in cash inflow from financing activities, rising from $945,000 to $2,349,000. From 2021 onwards, the amount remained constant at $2,349,000 for both 2022 and 2023. This indicates that after an initial surge, the company's financing activities stabilized at a higher level.\n\n**Percentage Increase Calculation:**\n\nTo calculate the percentage increase from 2020 to 2024, we use the formula:\n`Percentage Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100`\n\nUsing the values for 2020 ($945,000) and 2024 ($2,349,000):\n\n`((2,349,000 - 945,000) / 945,000) * 100`\n= `(1,404,000 / 945,000) * 100`\n≈ `148.5%`\n\nTherefore, the trend shows a substantial increase followed by stabilization, with a total percentage increase of approximately 148.5% from 2020 to 2024."

A negative value indicates a *cash outflow*, not an inflow.\n- **Advances on credit line**: $44,415,120 — This is a *cash inflow*.\n- **Payments on credit line**: $(56,715,120)$ — This is a *cash outflow*.\n- **Commercial paper issued**: $30,920,487 — This is a *cash inflow*.\n- **Commercial paper redeemed**: $(18,922,918)$ — This is a *cash outflow*.\n\nTo find the total cash inflows from financing activities, we sum up all positive values in this section:\n- Advances on credit line: $44,415,120\n- Commercial paper issued: $30,920,487\n\nTotal Cash Inflows = $44,415,120 + $30,920,487 = $75,335,607\n\nTherefore, the total cash inflows from financing activities for 1st Franklin Financial Corp were $75,335,607."

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, there is no company listed or mentioned that has an asset growth rate of $1,616 thousand.\n\nThe financial statements for several companies are included, such as Biolargo, Inc., GOFBA, INC., AST SPACEMOBILE, INC., AGRIFY CORPORATION, ALPHA INVESTMENT INC., EZFILL HOLDINGS, INC., and FOCUS UNIVERSAL INC. Each document contains condensed balance sheets showing total assets for the periods ended March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023.\n\nFor example:\n- **Biolargo, Inc.** (Image 4): Total Assets grew from $8,205K to $9,821K.\n- **GOFBA, INC.** (Image 57): Total Assets decreased from $2,546K to $2,268K.\n- **AST SPACEMOBILE, INC.** (Image 90): Total Assets grew from $360,892K to $501,728K.\n- **AGRIFY CORPORATION** (Image 105): Total Assets decreased from $45,270K to $40,861K.\n- **ALPHA INVESTMENT INC.** (Image 110): Total Assets increased from $14K to $297K.\n- **EZFill Holdings, Inc.** (Image 115): Total Assets decreased from $5,717,332K to $5,846,645K.\n- **FOCUS UNIVERSAL INC.** (Image 120): Total Assets decreased from $5,334,124K to $4,965,198K.\n\nNone of these figures correspond to a growth rate of $1,616 thousand. The closest figure is for AST SPACEMOBILE, which had a growth of $140,836K ($501,728K - $360,892K), but even this does not match the specified value.\n\nTherefore, it is impossible to identify a company with the given asset growth rate from the provided data."

Question you need to answer: How many companies have a 'Net cash flow from financing activities change compared to the previous reporting period' exceeding $100,000?",
    "answer": "To determine how many companies had a 'Net cash flow from financing activities change' exceeding $100,000 compared to the previous reporting period, we must examine the \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" for each company listed in the provided documents.\n\nThe relevant data is located in the \"Cash flows from financing activities\" section of each company's statement. We will look at the \"Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\" line item under the \"Financing Activities\" section, which represents the net change in cash from financing activities over the period.\n\nLet’s analyze each company:\n\n1.  **Broadway Financial Corporation**:\n    -   The document does not provide a specific \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure for financing activities.\n    -   Instead, it provides a breakdown of cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities separately.\n    -   For financing activities, it shows \"Net cash used in financing activities\" was ($3.0 million) for Q1 2024, compared to ($16.1 million) for Q1 2023.\n    -   However, the \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is not explicitly stated for financing activities alone; it is calculated by summing up all three sections.\n    -   Therefore, we cannot definitively calculate the exact net change for financing activities alone from this report.\n\n2.  **Biologo, Inc.**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net cash provided by financing activities\" for Q1 2024 was $1,083 thousand, compared to $1,510 thousand for Q1 2023.\n    -   This indicates a decrease of $427 thousand, which is less than $100,000 in absolute value but negative.\n    -   The \"Net change in cash\" line item is not directly provided for financing activities.\n\n3.  **Dawson Geophysical Company**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net cash used in financing activities\" for Q1 2024 was ($582) thousand, compared to ($3,224) thousand for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents an improvement (less negative), but the net change in cash from financing activities is not explicitly given.\n    -   The \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is not directly available for financing activities.\n\n4.  **General Enterprise Ventures, Inc.**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net cash provided by financing activities\" for Q1 2024 was $1,650,000, compared to $1,850,000 for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents a decrease of $200,000, which is less than $100,000 in absolute value but negative.\n    -   Again, the \"Net change in cash\" figure is not explicitly provided for financing activities.\n\n5.  **Harte Hanks, Inc.**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net cash provided by financing activities\" for Q1 2024 was $13,041,000, compared to $8,097,000 for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents an increase of $4,944,000, which exceeds $100,000.\n    -   The \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is not directly provided for financing activities.\n\n6.  **Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\" for Q1 2024 was $1,357,817, compared to $(74,742) for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents an increase of $1,432,559, which exceeds $100,000.\n    -   The \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is explicitly provided for the entire period.\n\n7.  **Ault Alliance, Inc.**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net cash provided by financing activities\" for Q1 2024 was $13,041,000, compared to $8,097,000 for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents an increase of $4,944,000, which exceeds $100,000.\n    -   The \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is not directly provided for financing activities.\n\n8.  **American Shared Hospital Services**:\n    -   The condensed consolidated statements show \"Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents\" for Q1 2024 was $2,829,000, compared to $3,658,000 for Q1 2023.\n    -   This represents an improvement (less negative), but the net change in cash from financing activities is not explicitly given.\n    -   The \"Net increase (decrease) in cash...\" figure is not directly available for financing activities.\n\nBased on the analysis, two companies clearly meet the criteria: **Harte Hanks, Inc.** and **Divall Insured Income Properties 2 Limited Partnership**, both showing increases in net cash flow from financing activities that exceed $100,000 when comparing Q1 2024 to Q1 2023.\n\nTherefore, the number of companies with a 'Net cash flow from financing activities change' exceeding $100,000 is 2."

    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, we can identify the \"Total Owners' Equity\" for each company by examining their condensed consolidated balance sheets or similar equity summaries.\n\n1.  **Blue Dolphin Energy Company**: The Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 18) show \"TOTAL STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\" at $108,484 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n2.  **The Arena Group Holdings, Inc.**: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 97) show \"Total liabilities, mezzanine equity and stockholders’ deficiency\" at $120,291 thousand for March 31, 2024. This is presented as total equity/deficiency, which is equivalent to Total Owners' Equity in context.\n3.  **AGEAGLE AERIAL SYSTEMS INC.**: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 156) show \"Total Assets\" of $23,221,107 thousand and \"Total Liabilities\" of $14,168,187 thousand. Therefore, Total Owners' Equity = Total Assets - Total Liabilities = $23,221,107 - $14,168,187 = $9,052,920 thousand.\n4.  **GLOBAL CLEAN ENERGY HOLDINGS, INC.**: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 187) show \"Total Shareholders' Equity\" of $70,755,506 thousand for March 31, 2024.\n5.  **CPI AEROSTRUCTURES, INC.**: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 207) show \"Total Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\" of $70,755,506 thousand for March 31, 2024. Since Total Liabilities are listed separately, we can infer that the remaining amount represents Total Owners' Equity. However, the exact breakdown isn't provided, but the total figure is given.\n6.  **BROAD STREET REALTY, INC.**: The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (image 237) show \"Total Liabilities, Temporary Equity and Permanent Equity\" of $352,057 thousand for March 31, 2024.

This indicates no net cash inflow or outflow from investing activities; it is effectively zero.\n    *   However, looking at the specific line items, there is an entry for \"Purchases of property and equipment\" which is listed as \"$ -\", meaning no purchases were made during the period. There are no other entries listed under investing activities. Therefore, the total cash flow from investing activities is indeed $0.\n\n2.  **CPI Aerostructures, Inc.:** The \"Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\" (page 8) shows that under \"Cash flows from investing activities,\" the line item is \"Net cash used in investing activities\" with a value of \"$ (46,775)\".

    "answer": "{\n  \"Reference\": [],\n  \"Citation\": [\n    \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a pivotal innovation in natural language processing, enhancing generative models by incorporating external information retrieval.\",\n    \"The binary notion of hallucination developed in Dahl et al. (2024) does not fully capture the behavior of RAG systems, which is currently being used inconsistently by different industry actors.\",\n    \"In this work, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of LLMs on both CRS tasks, including response generation and recommendation, and underscore the challenges in LLM-based CRS.\",\n    \"Our analysis reveals that integrating both factual and item-based knowledge can significantly boost the performance of LLM-based CRS. However, knowledge-enhanced approaches for LLM-based CRS present unique challenges that have been relatively underexplored compared to prior training-based methods in CRS or retrieval-augmented (RA) methods in NLP (Zhang, 2023; Di Palma, 2023).\",\n    \"To address these challenges, we employ a relation-based method that allows LLMs to flexibly plan and quickly retrieve relevant \\\"entity-relation entity\\\" knowledge triples $K$ by traversing along the relations $R$S of mentioned entities $E$ (Mao et al., 2019; Jiang et al., 2023). For instance, when discussing a celebrity without a clear query (e.g., \\\"I love Cecilia...\\\") the system first extracts all potential relations from the knowledge bases from the dialogue utterance $S$, then extracts candidate relations (denoted as $R^*$) based on the user's likely interests.\",\n    \"For each dialogue history $C_{-i}$, the LoRA model is trained to generate the dialogue goal $G^{*}(\\cdot)$ for the next utterance using the prompt of dialogue history, optimizing the loss function in Eq. 2 with $\\theta$ representing the trainable parameters of LoRA. The detailed prompt and instructions are shown in Table 11 (§ A.3).\",\n    \"In this section, we evaluate the accuracy based on the different noise ratios in external documents, and the results are shown in Table 1. We can see that: (1) RAG can effect improve the responses of LLMs. LLMs have shown strong performance even in the presence of noise, indicating that RAG is a promising way for LLMs to generate accurate and reliable responses.\",\n    \"In order to assess the effectiveness of our adaptive retrieval approach, we conducted fine-tuning of the Llama-2 model on both the NQ and SQuAD datasets across all three configurations. As a result of this process, the $74.72\\%$ of the questions are marked with the $\\\\angleleftmathrm{RET}\\\\rangle$rangle$ token, whereas the $87.49\\%$ questions are marked for SQuAD.\",\n    \"These findings provide insights into the effectiveness of the decision-making process employed by the ADAPT-LLM model in determining the necessity of additional context for accurate response generation and present empirical evidence of the necessity of performing dynamic context retrieval in improving the accuracy of question answering models.\",\n    \"Through extensive experiments conducted on the PopQA dataset, we show that ADAPT-LLM performs better than its two fixed alternatives: never retrieving and always retrieving relevant context information. Furthermore, our findings highlight the efficacy of ADAPT-LLM’s capability to effectively discern the necessity of context, which is the primary objective of this work.\",\n    \"We propose a novel data synthesis framework for multi-hop question answering that requires less than 10 human-annotated QA pairs and minimal hand-crafted features.\",\n    \"Unlike prior work on data synthesis for MQA (Pan et al., 2021), which often depends on carefully designed templates to facilitate complex question generation, limiting the diversity of types of reasoning questions, our approach requires minimal hand-crafted features as it is built upon LLMs’ prompting capabilities.\",\n    \"In this work, we propose to synthesize training data for multi-hop question answering using a handful of human-annotated QA pairs (see Figure 1 for an overall pipeline of our approach). The framework seeks to generate MQA data using questions that are related in different aspects, e.g., sharing similar topics, providing extra information about entities, or talking about events occurred in sequence. This framework is general in that (1) the relationships among documents are naturally occurring, covering a diverse set of reasoning types; and (2) the data generation pipeline depends on few hand-crafted, task-dependent features.\",\n    \"In this work, we propose a novel data synthesis framework for multi-hop question answering that requires less than 10 human-annotated QA pairs and
